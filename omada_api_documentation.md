1.3 Process Introduction
Omada's Open API supports the REST API of most Controller services. This feature allows Omada users to write custom applications, embed APIs, or combine their own applications. The REST API supports HTTP GET and POST operations by providing specific URLs for each query. The output of these operations is returned in JSON format. To access the API securely, the Omada API framework supports the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization, which allows you to access resources authorized by users without obtaining user names and passwords, and supports the authorization code mode and client credentials mode.

The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients. Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection) from the authorization server.

The following is the authorization code mode process：
1、The user visits the client.
2、The client directs the user to the authentication server (Omada).
3、User logs in (/openapi/login), and authorize the third-party client.
4、The authentication server directs the user to the redirection URL specified by the client in advance, and attaches an authorization code (redirect URL + ?code={authorization code}, if the redirect URL is https://redirect.com, it is https://redirect.com?code=authCode).
5、The client uses the authorization code to exchange the accessToken from the authentication server (Omada).
6、The authentication server (Omada) authenticates the client and issues an access token.
7、The client uses the access token to apply for resources from the resource server (Omada).
8、The resource server (Omada) confirms the access token and opens resources to the client.
9、The client can exchange an access token through refresh token, client ID, and client secret.

The client can request an access token using only its client credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the client is requesting access to the protected resources under its control, or those of another resource owner that have been previously arranged with the authorization server (the method of which is beyond the scope of this specification).

The following is the client credentials mode process：
1、The user opens the client, and the client requires the user to authorize.
2、The user agrees to authorize the client.
3、The client uses the authorization obtained to apply for an access token from the authentication server (Omada).
4、The authentication server (Omada) authenticates the client and issues an access token.
5、The client uses the access token to apply for resources from the resource server (Omada).
6、The resource server (Omada) confirms the access token and open resources to the client.
7、The client can exchange an access token through refresh token, client ID, and client secret.

Note:
1、Each Omada Pro controller and each Omada organization has an API call budget of 10 requests per second.
2、Most interface has a concurrency limit. We recommend that you modify global configurations before other configurations of the site.

2 Access Process
2.1 Create Application
1、To access the Open API, first create an application at Settings > Platform Integration in the MSP or Global view. You can customize the content.：

Authorization code mode: You can define the Application name and Redirect URL. When calling the interface in this mode, the authority is the same as that of the login user.
Client mode: You can define the Application name and access permissions. When calling the interface in this mode, the rights are the same as the login Application.
2、After the creation is successful, each Application will have a corresponding client ID and client secret, which will be used for subsequent access to the Open API. You can view the details on the interface to know the Omada ID and the access address of the Open API.

2.2 Authorization Code Mode Access Process
2.2.1 Login Authentication & Obtain Authorization Code
2.2.1.1 redirect URL not specified
When the redirect URL is not specified, the operation process is as follows.

First of all, you need to log in. When using the Open API function later, its authority is the same as that of the current login user. The login interface uses the POST method, the interface path is /openapi/authorize/login.

In the Query, fill in the client ID (The field name is client_id) and msp id or customer id(The field name is omadac_id).
In the Body, fill in the user name(The field name is username) and password(The field name is password).
After logging in successfully, it will return the csrfToken, sessionId.
Note: Please save the return parameters for later use.

An example of the curl command of the login interface is as follows:
Request:

curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/authorize/login?client_id=38f2d1b616434374b3f3215246f39940&omadac_id=beed48c7a2b0ea97c9698408843119f3" -H 'content-type:application/json' -d '{"username":"admin","password":"tplink123"}' -X POST -i -k --insecure
Response:

{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Open API Log in successfully.","result":{"csrfToken":"51cb83c7d00a4e85b3dd2d6174a614d9","sessionId":"2fc0ca155ab94957a9a9e6a3b00662ea"}}
After logging in, you need to obtain the authorization code. The obtaining the authorization interface uses the POST method, the interface path is as follows: /openapi/authorize/code.

In the Query, fill in the client ID(The field name is client_id) and response type(The field name is response_type), msp id or customer id(The field name is omadac_id). The response_type represents the reply type, and is filled with "code" by default in authorization code mode.
In the Headers, fill in the csrf token(The field name is Csrf-Token) and cookie(The field name is Cookie) obtained in the login step. Note that the prefix "TPOMADA_SESSIONID=" is required when filling in the cookie. After obtaining authorization code successfully, it will return the authorization code.
Note: The authorization code is only available for 2 minutes. If it expires, you need to obtain it again.

An example of the curl command of the obtaining authorization code interface is as follows:
Request:

curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/authorize/code?client_id=29f2fdbeb5a84d50b9b1cdd08cd1a3ff&omadac_id=de382a0e78f4deb681f3128c3e75dbd1&response_type=code" -H 'content-type:application/json' -H 'Csrf-Token:ae6b935c92cf4b1b9f3eb852e20ed2b8' -H 'Cookie:TPOMADA_SESSIONID=9cb86bf3a99e48a59e4f3bb464a3c443' -X POST -i -k --insecure
Response:

{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Open API Authorize successfully.","result":"OC-9iyxaKVOVMBpYhQ4NryaYBjghj3dTY32"}
2.2.1.2 redirect URL already specified
When the redirect URL is specified, the operation process is as follows.

Omada customized the login page for the third party. Note that client ID is required to carry. When logging in directly through the login page, the user will be redirected to the third-party service with the authorization code. For example, if the redirect URL is http://test.com:8082/redirect/test, Omada will send a redirect request http://test.com:8082/redirect/test?code={authorization code}, and the client can directly parse the authorization code for subsequent processing. If you don't know your login URL, go to Settings > Platform Integration > Open API, find your application and click the View button to check the Oauth Login Page Address.

In the Query, fill in the client ID(The field name is client_id)
Note: If you need to redirect the authorization code, please contact our technical support to add your domain name to the trusted list of the Omada system.

2.2.2 Obtain Access Token
After the authorization code is obtained, it will be used to obtain the access token. The obtaining the access token interface uses the POST method, the interface path is as follows: /openapi/authorize/token.

In the Query, fill in the grant type(The field name is grant_type). The grant type indicates the authentication method, and the authorization code needs to be filled in with "authorization_code"
In the Body, fill in the client ID(the field name is client_id) and client secret(the field name is client_secret).
After obtaining access token successfully, it will return the access token(The field name is accessToken), token type(The field name is tokenType), expire time(The field name is expiresIn, unit is second), refresh token(The field name is refreshToken).

An example of the curl command of the obtaining access token interface is as follows:
Request:

curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/authorize/token?grant_type=authorization_code&code=OC-y8fyWAyICCqCWw44Oi9GeSr7fQIKHg7g" -H 'content-type:application/json' -d '{"client_id": "29f2fdbeb5a84d50b9b1cdd08cd1a3ff", "client_secret": "cf6b13af0dd045628c9f05f088eb5493"}' -X POST -i -k --insecure
Response:

{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Open API Get Access Token successfully.","result":{"accessToken":"AT-bllLYOOYASck11SBSDmmHs85lCrkN6Gi","tokenType":"bearer","expiresIn":7200,"refreshToken":"RT-HqvaDuSxEqayM75U2ukTRnBl6f6fiRAc"}}
Note: Access Token will become invalid in the following scenarios and require re-authentication:

Open API application deletion
Controller deletion
Controller restoration
MSP mode disabling
MSP mode enabling
Open API application modification
Token expiration
2.2.3 Access API Interface
After obtaining access token, it will be used to access API interfaces.

In the Header, fill in the access token. Note prefix of the access token in the Authorization header is "AccessToken=" .
Other parameters can be filled in according to the description in the online document

An example of the curl command of the get site list interface is as follows:
Request:

curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/v1/de382a0e78f4deb681f3128c3e75dbd1/sites?pageSize=1&page=1" -H 'content-type:application/json' -H 'Authorization:AccessToken=AT-RCio7FS9p46wSD7dM8CwNQA7ylcrmAcV' -X GET -i -k --insecure
Response:

{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Success.","result":{"totalRows":1,"currentPage":1,"currentSize":1,"data":[{"siteId":"640effd1b3f2ae5b912275ec","name":"323233232","region":"China mainland","timeZone":"UTC","scenario":"Hotel","type":0}]}}
2.2.4 Refresh Access Token
Currently, the access token is valid for 2 hours, and the refresh token is valid for 14 days. If the access token expires, you can use the refresh token interface to obtain a new access token. The refresh access token interface uses the POST method, the interface path is as follows: /openapi/authorize/token. If the refresh token also expires, you will need to go through the previous authentication process again.

In the Query, fill in the grant type(The field name is grant_type), refresh token(The field name is refresh_token). The grant type indicate the authentication method, and the refresh token needs to be filled in with "refresh_token"
In the Body, fill in the client ID(the field name is client_id) and client secret(the field name is client_secret).
An example of the curl command of the refresh token interface is as follows: Request:

curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/authorize/token?client_id=185586e0df424f5ea938de13cba91e01&client_secret=767372a5258a4fc1a03c57f3d071fc35&refresh_token=RT-AhzwqCenDCZ84qpBHnZhYs3j2RGw9q8E&grant_type=refresh_token" -H 'content-type:application/json' -X POST -i -k --insecure
Response:

{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Open API Get Access Token successfully.","result":{"accessToken":"AT-w9veJNQlaK8dH08qEQZCTas6y70IRAii","tokenType":"bearer","expiresIn":7001,"refreshToken":"RT-AhzwqCenDCZ84qpBHnZhYs3j2RGw9q8E"}}
Note: A refresh token can be used only once within its validity period. After you use the refresh token to refresh the access token, the current refresh token will become invalid and the interface response will return a new valid refresh token. Please update the refresh token for the next access token refresh.

2.3 Client Credentials Mode Access Process
2.3.1 Obtain Access Token
The client credentials mode can directly obtain the access token without the need to obtain the authorization code.

In the Query, fill in the grant type(the field name is grant_type). The grant type indicate the authentication method, and the client credentials code needs to be filled in with "client_credentials"
In the Body, fill in the msp id or customer id(The field name is omadacId), client ID(the field name is client_id) and client secret(the field name is client_secret).
An example of the curl command of the obtaining access token interface is as follows: Request:

curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/authorize/token?grant_type=client_credentials" -H 'content-type:application/json' -d '{"omadacId": "de382a0e78f4deb681f3128c3e75dbd1", "client_id": "185586e0df424f5ea938de13cba91e01", "client_secret": "767372a5258a4fc1a03c57f3d071fc35"}' -X POST -i -k --insecure
Response:

{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Open API Get Access Token successfully.","result":{"accessToken":"AT-bjaJkIMIiekZY6NBufoQO4hdmJTswlwU","tokenType":"bearer","expiresIn":7200,"refreshToken":"RT-3ZjJgcORJSh76UCh7pj0rs5VRISIpagV"}}
Note: After obtaining the token, if you copy or import sites, or change application permission-related parameters (such as role/site/customer privilege) in the controller, the original token will become invalid and you need to authorize it again.

2.3.2 Access API Interface
This step is the same as the authorization code mode.

2.3.3 Refresh Access Token
This step is the same as the authorization code mode.

2.4 Batch Processing OpenAPIs
You can process up to 20 other OpenAPIs through the OpenAPI Batch Processing OpenAPIs, excluding MSP OpenAPIs. All processing should use the same omadacId.

In MSP mode, You can process up to 20 other OpenAPIs through the OpenAPI Batch Processing MSP OpenAPIs. For dealing with MSP OpenAPIs, the same mspId should be used. For dealing with other non MSP OpenAPIs, the corresponding customerId should be used.
